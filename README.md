# ALSResearchStudy
This iOS app leverages ResearchKit library to perform Tapping Task and CoreMotion library to perform daily Step Count as a way of measuring an active task and a passive task in order to help gather relevant data for ALS research. 

We store the Tapping Task result (button, date, location and timestamp) and we store the day and the Step Count into the CoreData database.
